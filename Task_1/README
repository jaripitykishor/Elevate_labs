# Task 1 - Elevate Labs

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for **Task 1** of the Elevate Labs program. The task focuses on practical applications of data analysis, manipulation, and visualization using Python and relevant libraries.

The project demonstrates skills in:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data visualization
* Basic statistical insights
* Python programming for data analysis

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaripitykishor/Elevate_labs.git
cd Elevate_labs/Task_1
```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install required packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: If `requirements.txt` is not available, you can manually install essential packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook for Task 1:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Task_1.ipynb
```

2. Follow the notebook to see step-by-step data analysis, visualization, and insights.

3. For running Python scripts directly:

```bash
python scripts/task1_analysis.py
```
